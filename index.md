### About Me

I'm a **Software Engineer** located in Austin, TX open for hybrid or remote work. I enjoy spending time bouldering and belaying, spending quality time with my husband and two pups, and working on jigsaw puzzles.

I began my career in tech as an eCommerce Technical Support Specialist where I learned I enjoyed problem solving and frontend development. I then worked my way through Indeed and shortly after to the title of Software Engineer at Q2 Software. There, I was able to learn and gain great knowldge from senior software engineers on the team.

I then found a great opportunity to use my skills and knowledge in JavaScript, HTML/CSS, eCommerce, and frontend development at Extend, Inc., where not only was I able to utilize my knowledge in regex but also frontend integrations. After 7-8 months, I was unfortunately impacted by the company's layoff. Although I was part of the company reduction, I'm motivated and excited to see where my experience takes me in tech.
